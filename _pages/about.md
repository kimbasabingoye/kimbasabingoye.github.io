I am a master’s student in Data Management in Large-Scale Distributed Systems at Université Paris-Saclay, driven by a passion for harnessing cloud and data technologies to solve complex problems and deliver innovative solutions. With a vision to create a more efficient and data-driven world, I aim to design, develop, and deploy scalable data solutions that empower companies to handle massive datasets in distributed environments. My background as a software engineer at Huawei provided me with hands-on experience in telecommunication software deployment and integration, sharpening my problem-solving skills and adaptability. I thrive on strategic planning and logical analysis, always striving to turn data into actionable insights for a better tomorrow.

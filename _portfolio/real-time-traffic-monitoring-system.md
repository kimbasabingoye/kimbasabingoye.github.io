### Real-Time Traffic Monitoring and Analysis System

[Code Repository](https://bit.ly/4cpkBGQ)

#### Overview
The Real-Time Traffic Monitoring and Analysis System is a comprehensive project aimed at alleviating traffic congestion on national highways by leveraging data engineering and analytics capabilities on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This project demonstrates the creation of a data pipeline to collect, process, and analyze traffic data in real-time, providing valuable insights to improve traffic flow and management.

#### Objectives
1. **Data Collection:** Stream real-time traffic data from various sources.
2. **Data Ingestion:** Ingest data into a centralized data lake.
3. **Data Processing:** Process and transform the data for analysis.
4. **Data Storage:** Store the processed data in a structured format for easy querying.
5. **Data Analysis:** Perform real-time and batch analytics to generate insights.
6. **Visualization:** Create dashboards and reports to visualize traffic patterns and congestion.
7. **Automation:** Automate the entire pipeline for continuous data flow and processing.

#### Key Components
1. **Data Sources:**
   - Toll plaza sensors
   - Roadside traffic cameras
   - GPS data from vehicles
   - Historical traffic data

2. **Data Ingestion:**
   - **Pub/Sub:** Use Google Cloud Pub/Sub for real-time data ingestion.
   - **Dataflow:** Stream data processing and transformation.

3. **Data Storage:**
   - **BigQuery:** For structured data storage and querying.
   - **Cloud Storage:** For raw and historical data storage.

4. **Data Processing:**
   - **Dataflow:** For ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes.
   - **Dataproc:** For batch processing using Apache Spark.

5. **Data Analysis:**
   - **BigQuery:** For real-time and batch data analysis.
   - **Looker:** For data visualization and dashboard creation.

6. **Machine Learning (Optional):**
   - **AI Platform:** For predictive analytics and anomaly detection.

#### Expected Outcomes
- A scalable and efficient data pipeline to collect and process real-time traffic data.
- Insights into traffic patterns and congestion points.
- Interactive dashboards for traffic monitoring and decision-making.
- Predictive analytics to anticipate and mitigate traffic congestion.

#### Tools and Technologies
- **Google Cloud Platform:** Pub/Sub, Dataflow, BigQuery, Cloud Storage, Looker, Dataproc, AI Platform.
- **Apache Kafka:** For initial data streaming.
- **Python/Shell:** For writing data processing and transformation scripts.
- **SQL:** For querying data in BigQuery.
- **Apache Spark:** For batch processing on Dataproc.

#### Skills Gained
- Real-time data ingestion and processing.
- ETL pipeline development.
- Big data storage and querying.
- Data visualization and dashboard creation.
- Predictive analytics and machine learning (optional).

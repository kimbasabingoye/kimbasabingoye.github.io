# Portfolio

Here you'll find summaries of the major projects I've done since September 2024.
Update is on going to include older projects.

<!-- These projects span everything
from mathematical physics to machine learning, from finance to advertising, from
the theoretical to the practical.

The discussion here is generally non-technical; for the research projects,
related publications can be found in [my resume][1]. There are also links to
documents at the top of each page, which offer more depth. If you're curious
about technical details I've glossed over, feel free to [contact me][2]. -->
